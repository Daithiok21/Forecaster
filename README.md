Site for all your (limited) weather needs

End result of a college project for all of your (hopefully limited) weather needs.

Was a purely Javascript project which explains the many many lines of code...
...Imagine someday coming back to this to tidy up when im coming to terms with Jquery.

Inspiration for dynamic background images and output formatting from a similar project here: https://github.com/meskarune/mylocalweather
